A coin dice script that needs help

DON'T USE THIS SCRIPT. YOU WILL GET HACKED!
========
Hi everyone, I uploaded this script because, after buying it for 0.18BTC, I was testing it out on my live server and got all my dogecoins hacked (although, it was only 2000 coins). My guess is that it was a SQL injection attack. The thing I found out in my little investigation is that the hackers (2 players) got their account balance to say 999999999999999 (with no bet) and then withdraw the most available (for example I had only 2000 Dogecoins)

So I am giving it away to the community of GITHUB!

I will give a bounty of 0.1BTC to the person who will make the most commits in 2014.

Cheers

If anyone wants to donate funds will be added to the bounty!
